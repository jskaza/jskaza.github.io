<!--During the 2017 NBA playoffs, Celtics coach Brad Stevens was faced with a difficult decision when defending against the Cleveland Cavaliers: “Do you double and risk giving up easy shots, or stay at home and do the best you can?” It’s a tough call, but finding a good defensive strategy that effectively incorporates doubling can make all the difference in the NBA. In this paper, we analyze double teaming in the NBA, quantifying the trade-off between risk and reward. Using player trajectory data pertaining to over 643,000 possessions, we identified when the ball-handler was double teamed. Given these data and whether the defense was successful, we used deep reinforcement learning to estimate the quality of the defensive actions. We present qualitative and quantitative results summarizing our learned defensive strategy. In particular, when double teaming Kyrie Irving on the 3 point line, the learned policy suggests leaving a man on the opposite wing open upon an attack from left, and leaving a man in the paint open upon an attack from the right. Based on data from past seasons, when doubling against the Cavs, we estimate that the Indiana Pacers and the Atlanta Hawks had the most room for improvement, while the Chicago Bulls and the Golden State Warriors were playing closest to the learned strategy. Overall, the proposed framework represents a step toward a more comprehensive understanding of defensive strategies in the NBA.-->

<!--This study applies dynamical and statistical modeling techniques to quantify the proliferation and popularity of trending hashtags on Twitter. Using time-series data reflecting actual tweets in New York City and San Francisco, we present estimates for the dynamics (i.e., rates of infection and recovery) of several hundred trending hashtags using an epidemic modeling framework coupled with Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This methodological strategy is an extension of techniques traditionally used to model the spread of infectious disease. Using SIR-type models, we demonstrate that most hashtags are marginally infectious, while very few emerge as “trending”. In doing so we illustrate that hashtags can be grouped by infectiousness, possibly providing a method for quantifying the trendiness of a topic.-->

[Link](http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/QUuqdIWAicuGi2EeEmBF/full)
<!--Building upon previous studies that highlight considerable overlap in the influential factors of both obesity and depression, we employ a structural model to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of behavioural and demographic factors on obesity. We use new body mass index (BMI) to calculate the obesity status and find a significant relationship between an individual’s depression status and his/her obesity status. The results and simulations imply that demographic and behavioural factors can significantly influence the obesity status both directly and indirectly through their impact on depression. Therefore, this study suggests that models which do not account for these various pathways of influence are most likely misrepresenting the impact of these factors on obesity.-->

Curve. *Bryant University Center for Global and Regional Economic Development Working Paper

<!--In this paper, we explore a variety of models attempting to explain the pollution-income relationship (PIR). There has been much literature addressing the notion of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). Many researchers find an EKC relationship for certain pollutants, while others do not find evidence of an EKC relationship. There is also literature formally critiquing the EKC. We employ cross-sectional, panel, and time-series analysis to add insight into the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation, a research area that is far from consensual and that has practical implications. We ultimately find that the clearest case of an EKC effect in our study arises in the analysis of organic water pollution, while there is modest evidence suggesting an EKC effect with regard to CO<sub>2</sub>, NO, and methane. We also present ample evidence suggesting an anti-EKC effect for PM10. Our analysis causes us to question the existence of an EKC effect throughout the environment in general.-->
