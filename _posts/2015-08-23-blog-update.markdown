I recently decided to switch over to a new site and blogging platform. The URL for my new site is: [http://jskaza.github.io/](http://jskaza.github.io/). Please check it out and let me know what you think!

All of my posts from WordPress are accessible on my new site. However, old post comments are not visible on the new site, though I have set up a new commenting feature.

Note that everytime I post a blog entry to my new site, a link to the article will appear on my old WordPress site. However, I will not be maintaining the WordPress site any longer.
