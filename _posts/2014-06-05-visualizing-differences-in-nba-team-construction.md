Recently, both on television broadcasts of games and on talk radio
shows, I've heard several discussions relating to roster composition in
sports. In the NBA, much discussion regards the notion of needing to use
free agency in order to acquire a "big three" and compete for an NBA
championship.  And with the NBA finals, featuring Miami's
well-publicized "big three", tipping-off tonight, I decided to look into
how each NBA team acquired its players.

Without any complementary analysis (I would like to be able get into
that another time), I've included a radar chart and table in this post.
(Note: the table illustrates the percent of a team's 2013-2014 roster,
according to [RealGM Basketball](http://basketball.realgm.com/), derived
from a specific talent acquisition avenue). Again, it would be
fascinating to conduct a detailed study concerning optimal roster
construction (and to add money devoted to each method of acquiring
players into the analysis), but for now, let's note that both NBA finals
participants (particularly Miami) have relied heavily upon free agency
in crafting their rosters.
