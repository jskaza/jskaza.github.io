Major League Baseball welcomed its [2014 Hall of Fame
class](http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article//hall-of-fame-class-of-2014-takes-its-place-among-games-legends?ymd=20140727&content_id=86542006)
on July 27<sup>th</sup>. This inspired me to create [this
visualization](https://public.tableausoftware.com/views/HOFStates/HOFersByState?:embed=y&:display_count=no). It
is interactive, so click around! I couldn't find a way to embed it
within the site, so hopefully the link works.
