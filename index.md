I am a prospective PhD student interested in performing interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Cognitive Science, AI, and Neuroscience, and to use methods from all of these disciplines bidirectionally--i.e., to improve the understanding of the human brain and also to improve AI systems. Additionally, I have a keen interest in responsible, human-centered AI.

Areas of interest: *computational cognitive science, biologically-plausible AI, neuroAI*

<!-- Currently, I am an Associate Director of Product Management at [Panalgo](https://panalgo.com/). Previously, I was a member of the Health Analytic Solutions team at Panalgo. My contributions fall into four primary buckets:

- Creating and planning product enhancements while also triaging bugs
- Developing, testing, and validating features and machine learning tools for the platform
- Providing technical support, guidance, and documentation for users
- Streamlining and automating reproducible internal workflows -->

Previously, I received my MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan, during which I worked with the Department of Psychiatry, and BS with a double major in Applied Economics and Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics from Bryant University.
