I am an Associate Director of Product Management at [Panalgo](https://panalgo.com/). Previously, I was a member of the Health Analytic Solutions team at Panalgo. My contributions fall into four primary buckets:

- Creating and planning product enhancements while also triaging bugs
- Developing, testing, and validating new features for the platform
- Providing technical support and guidance for users
- Streamlining and automating internal workflows as well as business analytics reporting

I received my MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan and BS in Applied Economics and Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics from Bryant University.
