I am a member of the Health Analytic Solutions team at [Panalgo](https://panalgo.com/), where I help develop and support our IHD software. My contributions fall into three primary buckets:

- Providing technical support and guidance for users
- Developing, testing, and validating new features for the platform
- Streamlining and automating internal workflows as well as business analytics reporting

I received my MS in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan and BS in Applied Economics and Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics from Bryant University.

A copy of my resume can be found [here](/assets/res.pdf).
