I work as a Computational Science Developer in the [Cowley Group](http://cowleygroup.cshl.edu/) at [Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory](https://www.cshl.edu/). Moreover, I am a prospective PhD student interested in performing interdisciplinary research at the intersection of Cognitive Science, AI, and Neuroscience, and to use methods from all of these disciplines bidirectionally--i.e., to improve the understanding of the human brain and also to improve AI systems.

Areas of interest: *cognitive computational neuroscience, biologically-plausible AI, neuroAI, XAI, reproducible research*

Previously, I served as a Solutions Analyst and subsequently Associate Director of Product at [Panalgo](https://panalgo.com/).
