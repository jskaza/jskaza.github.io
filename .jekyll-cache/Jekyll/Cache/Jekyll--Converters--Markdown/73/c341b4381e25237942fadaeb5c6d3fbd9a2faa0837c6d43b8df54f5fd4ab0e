I"Û<p>Recently, both on television broadcasts of games and on talk radio
shows, Iâ€™ve heard several discussions relating to roster composition in
sports. In the NBA, much discussion regardsÂ the notion of needing to use
free agency in order to acquire a â€œbig threeâ€ and compete for an NBA
championship.Â Â And with the NBA finals, featuring Miamiâ€™s
well-publicized â€œbig threeâ€,Â tipping-off tonight, I decided to look into
how each NBA team acquired its players.</p>
