I"ä<p>To determine the best draft pick in NBA history, it is first necessary to establish some ground rules, since the NBA Draft is everchanging. To remove some of the inter-draft variation, I will confine the analysis to drafts of the Lottery Era (1985-present). Additionally, I will only consider selections made with picks 1-60 in each draft, as the NBA Draft included more than two rounds in the late 1980s. The NBA Draft has featured exactly 60 selections each year since 2005.</p>
