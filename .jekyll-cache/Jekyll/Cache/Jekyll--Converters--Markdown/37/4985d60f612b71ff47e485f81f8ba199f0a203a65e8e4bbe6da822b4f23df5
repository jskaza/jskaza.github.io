I"x<p>In regard to constructing elegant proofs, one of my mathematics
professors says, “It is important to know what to skip.” I write this
because it is not necessary for me to statistically analyze Peyton
Manning’s career in order to prove his greatness. This has been done
time and time again, and it is virtually fact that he is one of the
greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. However, I did want to offer a
quick thought on a recent, atypical, Peyton Manning interview, in which
<a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/09/18/peyton-manning-denver-broncos-unplugged/">The MMQB’s Peter King tried to ask the oft-interviewed Manning ten
questions he had never answered
before.</a></p>

<p>In particular, I thought Manning’s response to King’s question regarding
what advice he would give to young NFL quarterbacks was terrific. Here
is part of it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Don’t ever go to a meeting to watch a practice or a game without
having already watched it by yourself.’ That’s one thing that I have
always done. When the coach is controlling the remote control, he’s
gonna rewind when he wants to rewind. He’s gonna skip certain plays.
He’s not watching every single detail. When you can control the rewind
button, you can go in there and you watch—first, you better watch your
mechanics. Watch what you’re doing. Is your drop good? How’s your
throw? OK, now rewind it again. Now you better watch your receivers.
OK, looks like Demaryius Thomas ran a good route here. Not sure what
Julius Thomas was doing here. Then you better rewind it again and
watch what the defense is doing. So, there’s time in that deal. You
have to know what they were doing so you can help them. So that has
helped me. When I go in and watch it with the coach, I’m watching it
for the third, fourth, fifth time. That’s when you start learning.</p>

  <p>The other thing I would tell them: ‘To ever watch film without a pen
and paper in your hand is a complete waste of time.’ You do it that
way, you’re only watching it, as I call it, to please the coach. If
you’re in the QB room and you leave the door open so they can see you
in there, don’t. Shut the door. You ought to have the door shut.
Whether they know you’re in there or not, they’re gonna know by the
way you play out on the field. Don’t go showing off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Manning’s advice can be summed up in a way that makes it
applicable to many people, not just NFL quarterbacks. Namely, Manning
seems to be getting at the following: ‘Don’t do something—whether it is
school work, a research project, or an assignment at a job—just because
you are obligated to and your boss , instructor, or coach will be
watching; instead, take complete ownership of it and do it to better
yourself’. I think that too many times, people (myself certainly
included) do things just because it looks good (like Manning says,
leaving the door open so the coaches can <em>see</em> you studying or, perhaps,
making sure that your boss <em>sees </em>that you came in early). In reality,
we (to a certain extent) should not care about the external impression
we make when completing a task. I think the best personal growth and
outcomes come when we don’t do something for the sake of doing it, but
do something with the Manningesque mindset of conquering it, regardless
of whether people see us during the process. As Manning says, “Whether
they know you’re in there or not, they’re gonna know by the way you play
out on the field”.</p>

<p>Afternote: This is Manning when he is not mastering his craft.</p>
