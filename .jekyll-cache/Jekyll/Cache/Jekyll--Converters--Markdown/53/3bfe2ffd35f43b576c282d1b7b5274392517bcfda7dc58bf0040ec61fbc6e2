<p>As evidenced in some of my old posts (like <a href="https://jskaza.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/superhero-statistics-pt-i/" title="this one">this
one</a>Â andÂ <a href="https://jskaza.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/superhero-statistics-pt-ii/" title="this one">this
one</a>),
Iâ€™ve become somewhat of a fan of superhero movies and television shows
(though, as I have said before, not of the original comic books
themselves). The fall 2014 television season featured a number of
comic-based programs. Interested in comparing the popularity and success
of the shows that fit into this genre, I gathered some data from
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/" title="IMDb">IMDb</a> (accurate as of 01/12/2015) and
created some charts (included below). I focused on the five
shows discussed in <a href="http://www.geek.com/news/fall-2014-the-season-of-comic-book-tv-shows-1609730/" title="this article">this
article</a>: <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em>, <em>Arrow,</em> <em>Constantine</em>, <em>The Flash</em>, and
<em>Gotham.</em> Personally, I am very much a fan of both <em>Arrow</em> and <em>The Flash</em> (both <em>CW</em> products) and am (at least for the time being) a semi-fan of <em>Gotham</em> (<em>Fox</em>). I have never watched <em>S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> (<em>ABC</em>) or <em>Constantine</em> (<em>NBC</em>). As an interesting side note, <em>ABC</em> just recently started airing episodes of its newest <em>Marvel</em> program, <em>Agent Carter</em>. There are some other shows that have (arguably less obvious) origins in the comics, but I decided to look at the five
major ones listed above.</p>

<p>The overall IMDb ratings for the five shows look like this (as of
01/13/2015):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Show</th>
      <th>Rating</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</td>
      <td>7.5/10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Arrow</td>
      <td>8.2/10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Constantine</td>
      <td>7.6/10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>The Flash</td>
      <td>8.3/10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Gotham</td>
      <td>8.1/10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br /></p>

<p>However, I did not create charts with overall ratings in mind. Instead,
I was interested in performing an analysis which included data
pertaining to each episode of each show. I think that this sort of
analysis is probably better suited to evaluate a showâ€™s success, as in
my mind a good show possesses consistency. In other words, each episode
is worth watching. I would prefer a show that has consistent 8/10
episodes than one that has a handful of 6s and a handful of 10s. This is
why I enjoyed the second season of <em>Arrow</em> so much. It seemed as though
each episode significantly contributed to the overarching plot of the
showdown between Oliver and Slade or to a subplot that was just as
riveting. Just take a look at the episode ratings for that season. The
average rating is an 8.9/10 and all episodes are within 0.4 of the
average.</p>

<p>The first season, while still worth watching, posts an average episode
rating of 8.5 and all episodes fall within 0.6 of the average.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are the charts that I created.</p>

<p><em>Update (01/14/2015): In comparing seasons 1 and 2 of Arrow, it may be
more instructive to compare the coefficient of variation (CV) in each
sample. The CV for season 1 is 3.7% while the CV for season 2 is just
2.3%.</em></p>
