I"å<p>In basketball, we often hear that certain players need to get their fair share of shots during the game. Karl-Anthony Towns was criticized for his <a href="https://hoopshype.com/2018/04/18/minnesota-timberwolves-karl-anthony-towns-tom-thibodeau-coaching/">lack of shot attempts</a> in a playoff game versus Houston this year. In that game, Towns took nine shots compared to 14 from Derrick Rose and 11 from Jamal Crawford. This distribution seems opposite of what it should be. Ideally, your best players should take a relatively larger proportion of the shots. For one, they should be on the floor more and therefore have more chances. Additionally, even controlling for playing time, the more skilled player should take more shots.</p>
