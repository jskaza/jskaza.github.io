I"÷<p>On this past Thursdayâ€™s edition ofÂ Baseball Tonight, Jonah KeriÂ was
called upon to discuss MLB team run differentials (he also wrote about
it
<a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-30-cubs-mets-nationals-angels-run-differential/">here</a>).Â He
pointed outÂ that this early in the season, run differential may be even
more powerful in predicting end-of-season win-loss records than current
win-loss records themselves. This is not the first time Iâ€™ve heard this
tidbit, and Sean Forman does a nice job of explaining the rationale in
<a href="http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/looking-past-mere-wins-and-losses/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1">this
piece</a>.
In sum, run-differential says more about the quality of team than does
win-loss record because, especially early on in the season, win-loss
record can be skewed based on chance. Hence, a teamâ€™s 162-gameÂ win-loss
record is best explained by a combinationÂ of runs scored, runs allowed,
and luck.</p>
