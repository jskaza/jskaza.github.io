I"“<p>On this past Thursdayâ€™s edition ofÂ Baseball Tonight, Jonah KeriÂ was
called upon to discuss MLB team run differentials (he also wrote about
it
<a href="http://grantland.com/features/the-30-cubs-mets-nationals-angels-run-differential/">here</a>).Â He
pointed outÂ that this early in the season, run differential may be even
more powerful in predicting end-of-season win-loss records than current
win-loss records themselves. This is not the first time Iâ€™ve heard this
tidbit, and Sean Forman does a nice job of explaining the rationale in
<a href="http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/20/looking-past-mere-wins-and-losses/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1">this
piece</a>.
In sum, run-differential says more about the quality of team than does
win-loss record because, especially early on in the season, win-loss
record can be skewed based on chance. Hence, a teamâ€™s 162-gameÂ win-loss
record is best explained by a combinationÂ of runs scored, runs allowed,
and luck.</p>

<p>Keri pointed out that this is about the time of the season when we can
start trusting run differential to tell us about the quality of a team.
Russell A. Carleton illustrates why this is
soÂ <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=23497">here</a>,
though his more advanced calculation, which employsÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach's_alpha">Cronbachâ€™s
alpha</a>, seems toÂ suggest
we should wait a few more weeks.</p>

<p>Nevertheless,Â this topic got me thinking about which MLB teams are most
balanced (a lot of runs scored and few runs allowed, or, in other words,
solid hitting, pitching and fielding).</p>

<p>First, I looked into team OPS numbers:</p>

</a></p>

<p><strong>Quick Comments:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>As is to be expected, the Rockies, who play well-above sea level
inÂ Denver, CO, have the highest OPS (though I would argue that the
number is still impressive even after accounting forÂ geography). I
did not adjust for <a href="http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/parkfactor">park <span style="text-decoration:underline;">factors</span></a>Â in
this particular analysis.</li>
  <li>The Angels, Tigers, and (especially) the Aâ€™s all have impressive
places within the plot (a team that has a better OPS than that which
it surrenders to opponents is of course below the 45-degree line).</li>
</ul>

<p>I then plotted runs/game vs. runs allowed/game and calculated a
standardized version of run-differential: $\frac{\text{runs scored} - \text{runs
allowed}}{\text{games played}}$.

<p><strong>Â QuickÂ Comments:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Again, the Oakland Aâ€™s post a very, very impressive run
differential figure.</li>
  <li>The 17-28 Cubs post a record not at all reflective of
their run-differential.</li>
  <li>The Dâ€™backsÂ could use some pitching help.</li>
  <li>Though Colorado scores theÂ most runs in baseball (see discussion
above), they are still holding opponents to much fewer runs than
they score. Thus, seeing that they play their games in the same
ballpark as their opponent, this analysis bodes very well for
the Rockies.</li>
</ul>

<p>With all of this in mind, the most impressive teams thus far in terms of
<em>balance</em> (which is vital to sustained success in any sport) and the
ones that would seem to be in it for the long haul are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Oakland</li>
  <li>Detroit</li>
  <li>San Francisco</li>
  <li>LA Angels</li>
  <li>Colorado Rockies</li>
</ol>

<p>You can of course interpret the data however youâ€™d like. These are my
five most balanced teams, as of now. Â Oaklandâ€™s season is off to an
unbelievable start and they deserve particular recognition (at least
double the per game run differential of that for every other team!) but,
of course, who knows what the future holds. This list is very likely to
change as the season progresses, but, for now, realize that the Aâ€™s
areÂ playing tremendous (dare I say historic?) baseball.</p>
