I"t6<p>Today, I will post the first of several entries relating to a unique
dataset that I’ve put together—a dataset that contains over 600 rows of
data on a topic of great importance……………..superheroes and
supervillains! Okay, analyzing superhero data may not be the most urgent
matter that we as a society face, but:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I think that it is often useful to include entertaining applications
when demonstrating what may otherwise be dry statistical methodology
(though, admittedly, I sometimes find the “dry” statistics entertaining
as well).</li>
  <li>I find it fun to casually talk to friends about superheroes
(especially those in recent movies) simply because, well, it’s just
that: fun! And much like sabermetricians use statistics to challenge
what is thought to be conventional baseball wisdom, I hope to use
statistics to address pertinent topics relating to superheroes and
supervillains (let’s call this discipline supermetrics?).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Setting the Stage</strong></p>

<p>Before I get into the statistical analysis of the data, I must put a few
things on the table.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Disclaimer</strong> I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do
not </span>claim to be a superhero enthusiast, expert, or anything of
the kind. I don’t think I have ever read a comic book in my life. I am,
however, a fan of superhero movies (e.g., <em>Man of Steel</em>, <em>The Dark
Knight</em>, <em>Captain America</em>, <em>The Avengers</em>, etc.) along with the
television show, <em>Arrow.</em> So what does this tidbit have to do with
anything? For one, with regard to my statistical analyses, it’s probably
a good thing that I’m not a huge supporter of any given hero or villain.
This should play a role in producing unbiased results. Additionally, my
unfamiliarity with the comic book universe becomes a disadvantage in
terms of data familiarity. Namely, I am fairly confident that I would
not be able to recognize any superhero that is over- or underrated (more
on the data below), making erroneous calculations more likely. With this
in mind, if any comic book experts out there see any peculiar results,
they are certainly welcome to leave a comment or drop me an email.</li>
  <li><strong>Data</strong> The data in the dataset that I will use to conduct my
analyses come courtesy of the <a href="http://www.superherodb.com/">Superhero
Database</a>. This site houses a collection of
information about 611 superheroes and villains. Each character (with
data) is given a score between 0 and 100 (except in a few rare cases,
where characters are deemed to be worthy of scores greater than 100) for
six different traits: Intelligence, Strength, Speed, Durability, Power,
and Combat. For example, here are the ratings for Batman:</li>
</ol>

<table align="center">
<tr>
<td><b>Intelligence</b></td> 
<td><b>Strength</b></td>
<td><b>Speed</b></td>
<td><b>Durability</b></td>
<td><b>Power</b></td>
<td><b>Combat</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>100</td> 
<td>18</td>
<td>27</td>
<td>42</td>
<td>37</td>
<td>100</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Correction. Each character actually has two sets of these ratings. One
such set is attributable to the creation of the website (the website was
created to log and rate superheroes) while the other set is an average
of user ratings. I chose to use the site’s ratings (the first set)
because it allowed for a more complete dataset (many heroes and villains
were not rated by users). In the event that the users rated the
character and the site itself did not, I simply used the users’ ratings.
After using this strategy, I came out with 440 superheroes/villains on
which to perform analyses (171 subjects without usable ratings from
either the site or its users).</p>

<p>I have one final note on the data. It is obviously highly subjective.
When a human being is rating anything, there is always an element of
subjectivity. Superheroes pose a particular challenge because they are
fictional (so we are assigning subjective ratings to characters that
were developed based on an author’s subjectivity). So please do not take
the analyses too seriously, but certainly have fun critiquing and
debating them! (Note: I do like how ratings can take on any discrete
value between 0 and 100. This large range allows raters to address
subtle differences among superheroes/villains.)</p>

<p><strong>Visualizing Differences in Superhero Traits</strong></p>

<p>The first items that I will present in analyzing this dataset are
heatmaps.</p>

<p><strong>Heroes</strong></p>

<p>I created a non-random sample of superheroes to include big names. I did
this using my opinions of which superheroes are popular and by surfing
the web for lists of popular superheroes. After I had a list of about 20
heroes, I generated a heat matrix using R that color-coded the six
attributes for each hero.</p>

<p>I really like this form of visualization. One is able to view 126
individual data points in this graphic and I can assure you that it is
easier to gain a grasp of the data using colors in the matrix rather
than numeric values. Does anything stand out to you? Martian Manhunter,
Superman, and Thor all have relatively high ratings across the board.
And as we saw above, while Batman is exceptionally intelligent and
excels in combat, he could use work in the other four departments.</p>

<p><strong>Villains</strong></p>

<p>I replicated the heatmap visualization using popular supervillains in
place of superheroes. (Note: This graphic is probably a bit biased
toward Batman villains, because those are the most familiar to me and I
felt compelled to include them!)</p>

<p>Here we can see that General Zod — who you may have recently seen in <em>Man
of Steel</em> — is, for lack of a better term, a beast. He possesses an
attribute score of at least 94 in each of the six categories.
Interestingly, it becomes apparent that many of the famous Batman
villains (e.g., Joker, Penguin, Riddler, and Two-Face) rely on a high
level of intellect to challenge Batman. Then, however, we have Ra’s Al
Ghul and Bane; both villains possess extraordinary combat ratings.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Remarks</strong></p>

<p>This post was devoted to introducing the superhero/villain dataset with
which I will be working in subsequent posts. Additionally, I took a
first step in statistically analyzing the data by visualizing
differences in characteristics among heroes and villains. I’d be
interested to hear whether anything jumps out to you when studying those
graphics!</p>

<p>In future posts, I aim to move beyond visualizing the data by applying
various statistical methods to the data. Hopefully you find the
superhero data and the relevant questions that can be addressed both fun
and entertaining, but also of practical importance with regard to the
statistical methods being employed.</p>
