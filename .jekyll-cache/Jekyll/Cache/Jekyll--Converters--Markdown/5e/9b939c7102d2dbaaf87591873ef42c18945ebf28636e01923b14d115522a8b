I"N<p>I recently decided to switch over to a new site and blogging platform. The URL for my new site is: <a href="http://jskaza.github.io/">http://jskaza.github.io/</a>. Please check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

<p>All of my posts from WordPress are accessible on my new site. However, old post comments are not visible on the new site, though I have set up a new commenting feature.</p>

<p>Note that everytime I post a blog entry to my new site, a link to the article will appear on my old WordPress site. However, I will not be maintaining the WordPress site any longer.</p>
