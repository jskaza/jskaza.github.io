I"¯<p>In regard to constructing elegant proofs, one of my mathematics
professors says, â€œIt is important to know what to skip.â€ I write this
because it is not necessaryÂ for me to statistically analyze Peyton
Manningâ€™s career in order to prove his greatness. This has been done
time and time again, and it is virtually fact that he is one of the
greatest quarterbacks in NFL history. However, I did want to offer a
quick thought on a recent, atypical, Peyton Manning interview, in which
<a href="http://mmqb.si.com/2014/09/18/peyton-manning-denver-broncos-unplugged/">The MMQBâ€™s Peter King tried to ask the oft-interviewed Manning ten
questions he had never answered
before.</a></p>
