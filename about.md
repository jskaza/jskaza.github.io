I am a Data Scientist in the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. I received my MS in Biostatistics from the department in 2017. I am currently working on statistical methods and applications in the modeling of cortisol, a biomarker of stress. Additionally, I am a member of the <a href = "https://biostatistics4socialimpact.github.io/">Biostatistics for Social Impact (B4SI) group</a> at Michigan. I completed my undergraduate work at Bryant University (Smithfield, RI), graduating with a BS in Applied Economics and Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics.

This site details my projects and publications. Additionally, I have been known to post an occasional blog entry so those can be accessed directly on the site as well.

A copy of my resume can be found [here](/assets/res.pdf).
