readme = "# peritus: a Zola theme for academic portfolio sites\n\n[![Zola](https://img.shields.io/badge/Zola-Compatible-blue)](https://www.getzola.org/)\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n![Theme Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jskaza/peritus/refs/heads/main/peritus-theme-preview.png)\n\nA clean, modular [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) theme for academic CVs and research portfolios. Inspired by the popular [Hugo Academic CV theme](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv), it is perfect for researchers, academics, educators, and students who want to showcase their work, publications, and achievements.\n\nüöÄ Check out a [live demo](https://jskaza.github.io/) to see the theme in action.\n\n## üåü Features\n\n- **Decouple Data from Design**: Content managed through structured TOML files, keeping your data completely separate from style\n  - Each content type (publications, experience, conferences, education, interests, social) has its own dedicated data file in the `data/` directory\n  \n- **Modular & Extensible Content**: Built-in support for academic content like publications, talks, and experience. New sections can be added by creating TOML files and matching templates.\n  - Follow the established pattern: create `data/newsection.toml` \n  - Add corresponding template in `templates/newsection.html`\n  - Add to the navbar in `config.toml` (see `config.toml` for an example)\n\n## ‚ö° Quick Start\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)\n\n### Installation\n\n1. **Create a new Zola site:**\n   ```bash\n   zola init my-peritus-site\n   cd my-peritus-site\n   ```\n\n2. **Add the theme to your themes directory:**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir -p themes\n   cd themes\n   git clone https://github.com/jskaza/peritus\n   ```\n\n3. **Configure the theme in `config.toml`:**\n   ```toml\n   theme = \"peritus\"\n   ```\n4. **Start the development server:**\n   ```bash\n   zola serve\n   ```\n\n## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration\n\n### Basic Configuration\n\nEdit `config.toml` to customize your site:\n\n```toml\n# The URL the site will be built for\nbase_url = \"https://markscout.xyz\"\n\n# Whether to automatically compile all Sass files in the sass directory\ncompile_sass = true\n\n# The site title and description; they are used in feeds by default.\ntitle = \"Mark S\"\ndescription = \"Professional Portfolio\"\n\n[extra]\n# Put all your custom variables here\n# The URL of the CV, which can be downloaded from the landing page\n# fictional example; replace with your actual info\ncv_url = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)\"\nname = \"Mark S\"\nrole = \"Macrodata Refiner\"\norganization = \"Lumon Industries\"\nlocation = \"Kier, PE\"\n\n# Bio/about section, this is prominently displayed on the landing page\nbio = \"\"\"\nHi, I‚Äôm Mark Scout. By day‚Äîor at least, what feels like day‚ÄîI work as a Macrodata Refinement department head at Lumon Industries. I‚Äôve undergone the severance procedure, which means my work self and personal self are completely separate. I can‚Äôt tell you much about what I do outside the office, because I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is that I take pride in leading my team and hitting quota, even if I don‚Äôt fully understand what our data means. People say I‚Äôm dependable, maybe a little reserved, but I try to keep things running smoothly. Lately, though, I‚Äôve started asking questions‚Äîabout the work, the rules, and what it really means to be \"me.\"\n\"\"\"\n\n# navbar items\n[[extra.menu]]\nname = \"Publications\"\nurl = \"/publications/\"\nweight = 1\n\n[[extra.menu]]\nname = \"Conferences & Talks\"\nurl = \"/conferences/\"\nweight = 2\n\n[[extra.menu]]\nname = \"Experience\"\nurl = \"/experience/\"\nweight = 3\n\n# Color theme configuration\n[extra.colors]\nprimary_color = \"#39444C\"         \nsecondary_color = \"#C8102E\"       \naccent_color = \"#98A6AD\"         \ntext_color = \"#2C2F33\"           \nbackground_color = \"#F8F9FA\"      \ncard_background = \"#FFFFFF\"      \nborder_color = \"#D0D3D4\"        \nlight_background = \"#EDF0F2\"      \n```\n### üìã Content Type Fields\n\nEach content type supports specific fields for structured data entry and templating:\n\n#### üìö Publications (`data/publications.toml`)\n```toml\n[[publication]]\ntitle = \"Your Paper Title\"\npub_year = 2025\nauthor = [\"First Author\", \"Second Author\"]\njournal = \"Journal Name\"\nvolume = \"12(3)\"\nurl = \"https://link-to-paper.com\"\nabstract = \"\"\"\nYour abstract text here...\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n#### üíº Experience (`data/experience.toml`)\n```toml\n[[experience]]\ntitle = \"Job Title\"\ncompany = \"Company Name\"\nlocation = \"Company Location\"\nstart_date = 2020\nend_date = 2025 # optional for current roles\ndescription = \"Role description...\"\n```\n\n#### üé§ Conferences (`data/conferences.toml`)\n```toml\n[[conference]]\ntitle = \"Presentation Title\"\nyear = 2025\nauthor = [\"First Author\", \"Second Author\"]\nvenue = \"Conference Name\"\nlocation = \"Venue Location\"\nlinks = [\n    { name = \"Slides\", url = \"https://slides-link.com\" },\n    { name = \"Poster\", url = \"https://poster-link.com\" }\n] # both optional\n```\n\n#### üéì Education (`data/education.toml`)\n```toml\n[[education]]\ndegree = \"Ph.D. in Field of Study\"\ninstitution = \"University Name\"\n```\n\n#### üî¨ Interests (`data/interests.toml`)\n```toml\ninterests = [\n    \"Research Area 1\",\n    \"Research Area 2\",\n    \"Research Area 3\"\n]\n```\n\n#### üåê Social (`data/social.toml`)\n```toml\n[[social]]\nname = \"Platform Name\"\nurl = \"https://profile-url.com\"\nicon = \"fab fa-github\"\n```\n\n## üìÑ License\n\nThis theme is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## üôè Acknowledgments\n\n- Inspired by the excellent [Hugo Academic CV theme](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv)\n- Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/)\n- Icons by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)\n\n\n\n*üõ†Ô∏è Contributions are welcome!
